# what is this ?

## Fetch financial information from yahoo finance.
This is a web application to easily fetch financial information. <br>
Internally it uses Yahoo Finance API and you can download the financials, BS, Earnings and CF in Excel sheet. 

## Ultra-simple UI.
This application is designed to be used by anyone, no matter who you are.<br> 
There is no need to learn difficult Python syntax anymore.

## All at once.
Have you ever had to search through every single excel file by company name? <br>
When you finally found it, did you ever despair that it was a PDF file?<br>
I'm sick of that experience. Get everything in one lump sum.
